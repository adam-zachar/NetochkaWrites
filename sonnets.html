<H3>Sonnet 5: When Spring Clouds</H3>

<p> We always know when spring clouds are to come,
<br>for puddles seep up from the ground to drip
<br>on skyward with a splash. The flower from
<br>his fulsome bloom folds tight in bud's green grip. 
<br>
<br>As freshness fades, then winter drifts up flow 
<br>and freeze and fly. The snow banks quick ascend
<br>to heavens as a rush of white. There's no
<br>ovation long enough. The bowing trees unbend.
<br>
<br>To take snow's place, the new brown leaves adorn
<br>blank empty trees. They crinkle as they drift,
<br>and once secured they fade to green. Once torn,
<br>they mend. Night's withered grass the sun will lift.
<br>
<br>To rains and snows and leaves we raise our eyes,
<br>and wonder how will we be called to rise.

<H3>Sonnet 4: My Bright Reflection</H3>

<p> My bright reflection leads me on a walk.
<br>His image is the clearer for the wind
<br>that ripples 'cross his face. I turn to talk
<br>and ask his name, but he moves on unpinned.
<br>
<br>My shadow now unmoors herself and on
<br>she goes alone. She sways and surges past
<br>the moon's light tides before the distant dawn.
<br>I hadn't thanked her yet. I thought she'd last.
<br>
<br>I move too fast, abandoned in my tracks,
<br>as trains in tunnels can but toward the light.
<br>But now, without a change, my vision cracks.
<br>I have no body left me in the night.
<br>
<br>What's left of me lives on within this text.
<br>Reflection's gone, then shadow, form. What next...

<H3>Sonnet 3: The Sonnet's Rules</H3>

<p> The sonnet's rules do guarantee no pure
<br>or rippling verse. Cheap rhymes like this allow
<br>the basic quatrain's flow to long endure,
<br>when with strategic line breaks joined as now.
<br>
<br>Excessive monosyllables permit
<br>the meter to be met too easily.
<br>Stress'd iambs, offset trochees, all submit
<br>as feet bound to their path obediently. 
<br>
<br>But such a forc-ed path is empty, bare,
<br>for metaphors, like wilted flowers weak
<br>on gravesides, note that long ago a care
<br>was taken once. Dead stems no longer speak.
<br>
<br>The couplet, though, does give a chance: to turn
<br>it on its head, or for the scribe to learn.

<H3>Sonnet 2: Shall I Compare Thee to a Night in Lab?</H3>

<p> Shall I compare thee to a night in lab?
<br>I stare far longer on the shifting shades
<br>of screens encircled by their beige walls drab
<br>than on your constant eyes as sunset fades.
<br>
<br>What sparks I feel caressing down your arm
<br>arrest me less than those that circuits leap.
<br>And though your still small breaths do my heart charm,
<br>from wheezing stalling motors my veins creep.
<br>
<br>Our whispered conversations fill my dreams,
<br>as nights we stretch out side by side unlit.
<br>But when I wake and find the piled reams
<br>of papers to review I want to quit.
<br>
<br>Though endless both seem, school and our love fast,
<br>it is but our time that will truly last.

<H3>Sonnet 1: My Thesis Text</H3>

<p> My thesis text looks nothing like it ought.
<br>"Results" to my "Conclusions" hardly flow,
<br>for each transition, tenuous and taut,
<br>would snap if stress'd more than a glancing blow.
<br>
<br>"Citations" is too strong a word by far
<br>to name the weak coincidence of all
<br>the papers cross'd my desk to meet the bar
<br>of relevance. But, so must I them call.
<br>
<br>My figures lie all in a disarray,
<br>and no array of subplots can disguise
<br>the ambiguities that 'neath them lay.
<br>The cliffs of "Future Work" before me rise.
<br>
<br>Yet, by a stroke of my advisor's pen,
<br>I know it never will be read again.
