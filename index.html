<P>---
<P>
<P>My thesis' text looks nothing like it ought.
<P>"Results" to my "Conclusions" hardly flow,
<P>for each transition, tenuous and taut,
<P>would snap if stress'd more than a glancing blow.
<P>
<P>"Citations" is too strong a word by far
<P>to name the weak coincidence of all
<P>the papers cross'd my desk to meet the bar
<P>of relevance. But, so must I them call.
<P>
<P>My figures lie all in a disarray,
<P>and no array of subplots can disguise
<P>the ambiguities that 'neath them lay.
<P>The cliffs of "Future Work" before me rise.
<P>
<P>Yet, by a stroke of my advisor's pen,
<P>I know it never will be read again.
