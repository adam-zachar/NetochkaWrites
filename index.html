<br>---
<br>
<p>My thesis' text looks nothing like it ought.
<br>"Results" to my "Conclusions" hardly flow,
<br>for each transition, tenuous and taut,
<br>would snap if stress'd more than a glancing blow.
<br>
<br>"Citations" is too strong a word by far
<br>to name the weak coincidence of all
<br>the papers cross'd my desk to meet the bar
<br>of relevance. But, so must I them call.
<br>
<br>My figures lie all in a disarray,
<br>and no array of subplots can disguise
<br>the ambiguities that 'neath them lay.
<br>The cliffs of "Future Work" before me rise.
<br>
<br>Yet, by a stroke of my advisor's pen,
<br>I know it never will be read again.
