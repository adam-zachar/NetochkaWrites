My thesis' text looks nothing like it ought.
The "Results" to "Conclusions" hardly flow,
for each transition, tenuous and taut,
would snap if stress'd more than a glancing blow.

"Citations" is too strong a word by far
for such passing coincidence of all
papers that cross'd my desk to meet the bar
of relevance. But, so must I them call.

My figures lie all in a disarray,
and no array of subplots can disguise
the ambiguities that 'neath them lay.
The cliffs of "Future Work" before me rise.

Yet, by a stroke of my advisor's pen,
I know it never will be read again.

Shall I compare thee to a night in lab?
I stare far longer on the shifting shades
of screens encircled by their beige walls drab
than on your constant eyes as sunset fades.

What sparks I feel caressing down your arm
arrest me less than those that circuits leap.
And though your still small breaths do my heart charm,
from wheezing stalling motors my veins creep.

Our whispered conversations fill my dreams,
as nights we stretch out side by side unlit.
But when I wake and find the piled reams
of papers to review I want to quit.

Endless they seem, both school and our love fast,
though 'tis but our time that will truly last.
