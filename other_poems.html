<H3>The Seasons' City</H3>

<p> Each winter the thick snow falls
<br>over each curb and corner
<br>and molds itself to the city.
<br>
<br>Come spring, the smooth ice melts
<br>and carries the city’s memory with it,
<br>down the river and out to sea.
<br>
<br>Then, the summer rain beats a staccato melody
<br>out across awnings and steepled roofs.
<br>It doesn’t linger long. It's not enough
<br>to remember the buildings’ shape.
<br>
<br>The tone of each striking raindrop
<br>fixes itself in the air,
<br>recalling the raw materials
<br>bent into each roof-shape.
<br>They tell the wood from the slate,
<br>from the metal-glass-cement.
<br>
<br>Finally, the tired autumn sun rises
<br>and inspects what of the city survived the seasons.
<br>The shadows he can't see are scoured by the harsh winds.
<br>And, before the sun can duck behind the horizon,
<br>those winds rush out to him bringing news of what they found.
<br>
<br>Why don't the little living things ever wonder at all this?
<br>How can they not ask, "Why are they studying us?"
