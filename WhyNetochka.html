<H2>Why "Netochka"?</H2>

<UL>
	<LI><i>Netochka Nezvanova</i> is a wonderful, if little-known and unfinished, novel by Dostoevsky that deserves more attention (<A href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780140444551">IndieBound Link</A>).
	<LI>Netochka (an affectionate form of the name "Anna") is close enough in Russian to "Anonymous" as to fit an online pseudonym.
